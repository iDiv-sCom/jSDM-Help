# What is the purpose of this website?

The purpose of this repo is to connect the statisticians assembled in sCom with people that run practical data analyses (classical community data or eDNA / metabarcoding data) with joint Species Distribution Models (jSDM). 

Typical questions could be

*  I have a dataset of size X, with this type of predictors, etc., which software should I be using? How to run the analyses. 
*  Here are my results &Picture& - I interpret this as saying that ... do you agree?
