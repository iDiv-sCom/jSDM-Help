# What is the purpose of this repository?

The purpose of this repo is to connect the statisticians assembled in sCom with people that run practical data analyses (classical community data or eDNA / metabarcoding data) with joint Species Distribution Models (jSDM). 

Typical questions could be

*  I have a dataset of size X, with this type of predictors, etc., which software should I be using? How to run the analyses. 
*  Here are my results &Picture& - I interpret this as saying that ... do you agree?

# What can jSDMs infer from your community data?

jSDMs can explain variation in community composition by contributions of the environment, space and biotic interactions, possibly aided / coupled with species-specific information, such as traits of phylogenies. A typical analysis could supply you with 

* Environmental responses / niches of each species
* Interactions / associations between species
* Spatial effects
* The relative importance of space, env, and interactions / associations
* If provided, correlations of traits / phylogeny with the respective components
